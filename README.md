<h1 align="center">ðŸ‘‹Welcome to the classic Snake Game!</h1>

**Game Setup**
The game is set in a 700x700 pixel screen with a dark gray background to improve visibility. A bright orange border frames the game area, creating a clear boundary for gameplay.

**Snake and Fruit**
The snake is represented by a series of green squares, which grows as it eats fruit. The fruit is a small red circle, providing a colorful and easily identifiable target for the snake.

**Gameplay**
The snake is controlled using the keyboard's arrow keys, with rules preventing it from reversing direction. The game ends if the snake hits the border or collides with its own body.

**Scoring System**
The score is displayed at the top of the screen in large white text, updating each time the snake eats a fruit. This provides a clear and easy-to-read indication of progress.

**Sound Effects**
I used Pygame to add sound effects to the game. There's a sound for when the snake eats a fruit and a separate sound for when the game is over. These sounds add feedback and make the game more engaging.

Overall Design
The goal was to create a classic Snake game with modern enhancements. Smooth animations, responsive controls, and sound effects combine to offer an enjoyable and immersive experience for players.
